Project Name: AthleteOS (Personal Prototype)
Owner: [Your Name] – Teacher, Digital Coach, Gentleman Athlete. Core Philosophy: "Context-Aware Performance." Target User: High-functioning adults (40s+) managing career, family, injury history, and neurodivergent traits (ADHD).

1. The Vision & Purpose
The "Why"
Traditional fitness apps fail because they are static. They assume the user is a robot with infinite time and no injuries. They induce shame when life gets in the way. AthleteOS is different. It is an Active Digital Coach that adapts to context. It bridges the gap between "Intention" (I want to be fit) and "Action" (I am doing the workout) by managing Executive Function and Dopamine.

The Core Goals
Physical Transformation: Move from "Maintenance Runner" to "Athlete" (Target: 11 Stone, defined core).

Mental Regulation: Manage dopamine addiction by replacing "Consumption Hits" (spending/eating) with "Earning Hits" (sweat equity).

Injury Management: Protect the back (bulbous disc) and hamstring while building strength.

Financial Discipline: Curb impulsive spending by "taxing" vices and rewarding savings.

2. The "Active Coach" Logic (Fake AI)
The system does not just display data; it intervenes based on heuristic rules.

A. The Context Engine
Before any recommendation, the system checks the user's status:

Physical: Injured / Rehab / Fresh / Peak.

Mental: High Energy / Low Energy / Anxious / Calm.

Location: Home / Office / Traveling.

B. The Intervention Logic
Scenario 1 (The Vices): User wants to buy wine/chocolate.

System Check: Do they have enough "Sweat Credits"?

Action: If No -> Block purchase. Suggest a 15-min task to earn credits.

Scenario 2 (The Injury): User logs "Back Pain".

System Action: Immediately lock all "High Impact" cards (Sprints). Unlock "McGill Big 3" and "Walking".

Scenario 3 (The Binge): User logs a high-carb/sugar meal (Pizza).

System Action: Schedule a "Glycogen Depletion Sprint" for the next morning. Frame it as "Fuel Utilization," not punishment.

3. The Feature Set
Phase 1: The Foundation (Identity)
User Profile: Weight, Injuries, Diet (Pescatarian), Equipment (Kettlebell, Dumbbells).

Metric Dashboard: Weight (vs. Milestones), Calories (In/Out), Wallet (Saved/Credits).

Milestones: Smart targets that respect life events (e.g., "Christmas Maintenance" vs. "January Hunter Mode").

Phase 2: The Command Center (Planning)
Weekly Grid: A visual planner for Meals, Workouts, and Mind sessions.

Smart Conflict Detection:

Alert: "You planned Sprints after a Poor Sleep log. Recommendation: Switch to Zone 2 Run."

Quick Add: Search bar to instantly find "Salmon Bowl" or "Deadbugs" and drop them into the day.

Phase 3: The Content Library (Card Factory)
Format: Cards with "Header + Content" style (Option B).

Video Integration: All exercises link directly to YouTube search queries (e.g., "McGill Big 3 form") to ensure immediate "How-To" access without broken links.

Categories:

Gym: Cardio, Strength, Rehab.

Kitchen: Meals (filtered by Budget/Time), Snacks.

Mind: Breathwork, Stoic Journaling, NSDR.

Phase 4: The Soul (Wellbeing)
Mood Meter: Quadrant check-in (Energy vs. Pleasantness).

Dopamine Ledger: Visual tracking of "Money Saved" by resisting impulse buys.

Morning/Evening Audit: A checklist to "Bookend the Day" (Shaved? Hydrated? Plan set?).

4. Design & User Experience (UX)
Visual Identity
Aesthetic: "Dark Mode Professional." High contrast, no glare.

Color Coding:

🟢 Green: Action / Health / Money Saved.

🔵 Blue: Logic / Planning / Study.

🔴 Red: Danger / Injury / Spending.

🟣 Purple: Wisdom / Mind / Budget.

Card Behavior: Solid cards (no transparency issues). Click to flip for details.

Accessibility (Level AAA)
High contrast text.

Screen reader friendly.

Mobile-first layout (touch targets > 44px).

5. Technical Strategy
The "Card Factory" Architecture
Codebase: Single HTML/JS engine.

Data: JSON text files (meals.json, workouts.json).

Benefit: Allows the app to grow infinitely without rewriting code. Can be easily "skinned" to become the Student Life Hub or Senior Tech app later.

Privacy & Persistence
Storage: localStorage (Browser). Data never leaves the device.

Backup: Feature to "Export Data to JSON" for safekeeping.

APIs: None. We rely on "Frictionless Manual Input" to avoid complexity and cost.
