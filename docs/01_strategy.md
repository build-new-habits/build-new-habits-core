01. Strategy & Vision: "Build New Habits"

Core Concept

We are building a Single Technical Platform (The Engine) that powers three distinct commercial products. The platform is not a passive tracker; it is an Active Digital Coach that provides scaffolded support for life skills, fitness, and digital literacy.

The Three Products

1. Student Life Hub (Commercial Flagship)

Target: Higher Education Institutions (B2B Licensing).

User: 18-25 year old students living independently for the first time.

Value Prop: Reduces dropout rates by solving "Life Admin" overwhelm (cooking, budgeting, loneliness).

Key Modules: Study Skills, Budgeting (Student Loan focus), Cheap Meals, Tenant Rights.

2. AthleteOS (Proof of Concept)

Target: High-functioning adults (B2C / Personal).

User: Busy professionals/parents balancing fitness with life/injury.

Value Prop: Context-aware fitness that adapts to injury, stress, and schedule changes.

Key Modules: Injury Rehab, "Vice Tax" (Dopamine Management), Contextual Training.

3. Senior Tech Skills (Social Impact)

Target: Local Councils / Libraries (Grant Funded).

User: Older adults facing digital exclusion.

Value Prop: Safe, anxiety-free environment to learn essential tech skills (WhatsApp, Scams, Zoom).

Key Modules: Large-text "How-To" guides, Simulation Cards.

The "Active Coach" Philosophy (Fake AI)

The system uses heuristic logic ("Smart Rules") to mimic an AI Coach without needing complex Machine Learning.

Example: It doesn't just list recipes. It detects "Low Budget" status and pushes the "£1 Meal Plan" to the dashboard.

Example: It doesn't just track exams. It detects "Exam Week" and switches the dashboard to "Focus Mode" (Pomodoro + Snacks).

Commercial Goals

Phase 1: Build the Core Engine and "Student Life Hub" MVP.

Phase 2: Pilot with one College (Insider Access).

Phase 3: License to other institutions as a White Label solution.
